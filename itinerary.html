  <h4 align="center"> I am not going to breakdown the cost because there are too many varying factors depending on your choices like, stays, where to eat, private or common sight-seeings, etc. According to our latest budgeting, it‚Äôs the flight which
    is costly. Also
    I read that most of the landmarks remain closed during ramadan and some have specific open days in general so checking before planning is adviced. This doesn't matter a lot to me because I like looking from the outside.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p> <strong>First thing first, take a flight to Istanbul from India or anywhere you are from.</strong> </p>

  <ul>
    <h3>Istanbul (Day 1 &2)</h3>
    <p><em>Constantinople! I read in The Bible and also watched many documentaries on civilisations. The country basically is a living breathing ground for pre-historic and historic ruins. I for one would love to see them all so its gonna be pretty
        tough to decide what not to see. Be in 2 continents(Asia and Europe) at the same time.. ok, in 20 mins. We will be staying on the European side of Istanbul of course. Lots of street food awaiting! And walk, walk, walk. Leave as many
        footprints
        as we can.</em></p>

    <h3>Ankara Day 9-10</h3>
    <p>There is nothing much that interests me in Ankara as per the articles I found in google. It's the capital city of Turkey and deserves a one time visit and as we are planning to do this trip by road mostly, it will be a good place to lay over
      for
      a night and also tick it off our list and head back to Istanbul in the morning (about 6 hrs drive from Ankara)to catch the flight back home. While we are at it, we may go see Anitkabir, a historical museum. The building structure itself is
      beautiful and can be worth a visit. And, in general, food in any part of Turkey won't disappoint us for sure so we will definitely check out the market area to indulge in some street food. </p>
