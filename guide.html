  <p align="center"> <strong>Don't rush me!. Anyone out there like me? I like doing things my way at my own pace. Naturally, I never buy a holiday package offered by Makemytrip and it's kind. I have been to 7 countries now and I couldn‚Äôt be more
      satisfied with my
      itineraries except for that one surprise trip. I must admit that Harshuwa has done a pretty good itineraries himself. The best part of planing by myself is having the luxury to choose the places I want to see by myself, Preplan where to eat,
      you
      don‚Äôt want to waste time deciding where to eat and have everything at my finger tips. And God forbid, if things go wrong, you can quickly turn around things and come up with a solution, keeping the anxiety away. Sometimes, it can be more
      economical and cover much more places and activities that is
      to your interest if you are a budget planner and can stick to it. I'm sure some of you have your own way to lay out the plan or have a better way, let me know. Okay, enough about how I feel, let's go ‚úÖ!

          <li><strong>CHECK VISA REQUIREMENTS</strong> </li>

        <td>
          <p> Broadly speaking, 3 types of Visa for tourism purposes. If Visa application is required, have proof of confirmed hotels & flights and daily expenses covered preferably in the local currency of where you plan to travel. Have some in the
            bank as well. Exchange
            currencies for rough estimate of daily expense before travel for your convenience.
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Visa On Arrival:</strong> The best of all. No need to do anything before travel. Get your passport and go, get an entry and exit seal at the immigration counter.</li>
            <li> <strong>e-Visa:</strong> Apply online 2-3 days before travel date and get it approved. you will receive an approval email. That is if you are not flagged by the Government.</li>
            <li><strong>Visa:</strong> The lengthiest of all, the ones that need be to applied months before actual travel date. I'm a spontaneous traveller. Just kidding, I hate waiting. I can think of planing a trip 1-2 months in advance and wait
              for it. I'd rather not go. The third one is not for me. </li>
          </ul>
          That is way I've not been to any Western countries. Also, they are Expensive! Tick the easy ones first from your BUCKET-LIST as you learn to travel and save up for the rest.
          <br>
          Last Month, we went to UAE. Few countries like UAE requires e-visas for Indians. For countries like this, submit the e-visas a couple of days before you travel and wait for the approval email. The smoothest immigration process ever!

          <p>I consider this as the most important thing one must do before you travel. This will either make or break your trip. The more you know about the country before you go the better. Think about it, we are planing to explore 1 or more whole
            countries in a very limited number of days. I usually compare and contrast 5-10 travel blogs. Check images and decide which ones will make it to the list depending on my interest. Basically, learn everything I could about the country.
            Must check for me is local cuisine, where to get the best local cuisine. I don‚Äôt necessarily choose every tourist spot, the less crowd the better. So, checking footfall and if its overhyped is also important for me. We have turned back
            from so many places just from looking at it from far. I can tell. Never doubted my insticnts one bit. But, the boys would say that I've lost my touch these days.</p>

          <p>I make a list of my top places to visit and things to do. It does not have to be a final but I roughly lay it out on the map just to check how far the places are from each other. This helps you in clubbing the places which are in the
            same route thus saving you a lot of time and energy. For places which are completely off the route, I consider my budget and the number of days I have and see if its worth a detour by a taxi or something. If not, just cut them off. This
            process is the main thing that helps me lay out my itinerary in the best way possible. Doing this can literally change the game of planning. You will know the country like the back of your hand which is an added bonus. Incase of trouble
            (I never stop thinking about this when planning) you can find your way out easily. Also life is so much easier when you know where things are.</p>

          <p>With the itinerary confirmed, and the routes confirmed, book your flight tickets and arrange other within country flights/train/buses if required to be booked in advance. The confirmed bookings receipts for flights and stays are required
            for show at the immigration/Visa application. You can look for cheaper dates and move your plan accordingly.</p>

        <td>
          <p>Out of my top places to visit, I finalise which places need a stay and which places can be done just as a day trip. Look for a stay where you can walk the streets and live like a local even if its just for a day. Always check out luxe
            stays before anything else. Sometimes it is comparatively cheap. If I can get a luxe stay at a reasonable price, I'll definitely go for it otherwise the cleanest(always end up taking a luxe one üòù the following line is just to argue that
            I
            can be low maintenance) I can get at my budget works for me. I recommend rooms with breakfasts. We've missed most of our breakfast when we travel within India but outside India, hardly. You don't want to waste too much time over
            what/where to have breakfast because you'll have less time to explore. With first meal of the day in your tummy, you are all set for the adventure.</p>

        </td>
        <td>
          <p> Then I come down to day-wise activities. I do this mainly to decide the types of clothes to pack according to my to-do list. This helps me pack light. It also saves a lot of time when you are on the actual vacation because you know
            exactly what you are going to
            wear. List the most absolute activities you must not miss. E.g. hot air ballon, beach hikes, sunsets, water sports, dirt activities, site-seeings, eat, shop or just stroll around and so on. I may sound a little OCD but I swear with crunch
            time you‚Äôll miss out on so many things with you don‚Äôt make a list.</p>

          <p> The lighter the better. First thing first, I check the temperature and weather conditions of the country I plan to visit. I plan exactly what I am going to wear each day of the entire holiday and pick a style of clothing that can go
            with one single footwear. You do not want anything unnecessary that can weight you down because you might want to shop in the foreign country and that can exceed your luggage limit. Also, everytime I return from a holiday even if I had
            not purchased anything new to bring back with me, I come back heavier than I left. Has this happened to you? On the other hand, if you want to pay extra, who am I to stop you? Pack anything you want. I may throw in an extra footwear and
            couple of tanks and Ts just incase. I recommend sports shoes or any comfortable shoe for exploring and long walks. And a light but sturdy and comfortable sandal. If you plan to have a cab/taxi with you the entire duration of your trip and
            have the money to do so, again, who am I stop you? Take your heels and have fun with it. üòÅ Every bit of clothing and footwear really comes down to it's comfort level
            for me. Uncomfortable clothes can ruin my day just like that.

    <p align="center" >Thats it! I wait for my travel date and cross check if my passport and other docs(if any) are in place and ready for the GO!.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <h3>Other tips from experience:</h3>
      <li><strong>Always store away your passport safe in your hotel locker.</strong></li><br>
      <li>Pack some longer shelf-live food items or purchase from a supermarket the moment you touch down and store it in your hotel for an emergencies like "HANGRY". Always a life saver.</li>
      <br>
      <li> And lastly but not the least, <strong>dress for the occasion! or respect the culture! or find out the cultural difference in general in terms of how to carry yourself</strong> so you don't come off as offending thier culture or land in
        jail. I generally don't care what other people think but I got really anxious while I was packing for UAE. I blame the hotel scene in Morocco from inventing Anna. Dubai turned out to be very chill like any other cities. Abu Dhabi was strict.
